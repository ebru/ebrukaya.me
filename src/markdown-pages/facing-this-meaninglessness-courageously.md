Today I finished reading **<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30369771' target='_blank'>Optimistic Nihilism: A Psychologist's Personal Story</a>**, and as always I am in love with a quote. The book itself was also a good read if you are quite stuck with searching for the meaning of life. If you are already a believer I'm not sure if it would make sense but still, it might be an interesting point of view to see.


```
"Life is not about faith or 
obsessing about the future, whether 
with hope or anxiety. 
It's about simply existing,
with courage, honesty and authenticity.
The philosophers seem to believe that
`What is the meaning of life?`
is a silly question.
There is no objective meaning to,
no extrinsic purpose of,
and no legitimate transcendence 
from the human condition.
The most meaningful
experience starts with
facing this meaninglessness courageously."
