**The Last Samurai** is one of the movies that I have watched with my father while I was little, and the only thing that I remember is that it was really impressive at that time. Therefore, I wanted to watch it again when I have heard a soundtrack from the movie, a way of life.

I think the Far East is one of the cultures that fascinates me the most. I have never been there, but the feeling I get even only from that sound is just simply amazing.

The movie itself is a masterpiece as well.
