2019 nearly comes to an end. This year I have read 25 books so far according to Goodreads, and I think the one I loved the most is **Momo by Michael Ende**. I always adore the beautiful quotes that I read in a book, they likely to tell me more than book itself. Momo in this way has really nice points to reach your soul, especially about time.

> "Life holds one great but quite commonplace mystery. Though shared by each of us and known to all, seldom rates a second thought. That mystery, which most of us take for granted and never think twice about, is time.

> Calendars and clocks exist to measure time, but that signifies little because we all know that an hour can seem as eternity or pass in a flash, according to how we spend it.

> Time is life itself, and life resides in the human heart."

I think I have never seen somewhere describing time that well before.
