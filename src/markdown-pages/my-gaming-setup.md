As I’ve mentioned <a href='/games' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">before</a>, I really love story-driven games and playing on consoles. Over time, I’ve put together a pretty nice setup. Lately, I’ve been playing mostly on Xbox and Switch, though I also have a PS4. As for the PS5? Not really interested right now. I’ll wait until there’s an exclusive game that really grabs my attention. For now, I’m happy with what I’ve got.

### main consoles

- **Xbox** -> Most often used, I like Game Pass.
- **Switch** -> For exclusive games like The Legend of Zelda.
- **PS4** -> For exclusive games like The Last of Us.

Recently, I played <a href='https://metacritic.com/game/it-takes-two/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">It Takes Two</a> on Xbox, and I absolutely loved it! The story is great, the gameplay is fun, and it’s just really well made for a two-player game. You can tell they put a lot of thought into making it enjoyable and natural to play. Definitely one of the best games I’ve played in a while. 

On Switch, I’m playing <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>. It’s pretty cool, but I really don’t like the fight logic—it kills the flow every time I run into an enemy. Not sure if I’ll ever finish it, same with <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. The map is so big and complicated that I haven’t really gotten into the flow yet even though I really enjoyed the first one, but I’ll definitely give it another try sometime.

Also, <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-jedi-survivor/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> is cool like the first one. And I just downloaded <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which I’m excited about, though first-person view isn’t really my favorite.

### nostalgia

I grew up playing Atari and PS1 games, so I have a lot of nostalgia for old-school gaming. I already have a few retro things, but my dream is to get a PS1 (should be slim), a GameCube (should be purple), and an old-school CRT TV to set up a proper retro gaming area. Until then, I’ve been using emulators, and they’ve been great.

I first started using emulators for Atari, but I’ve recently discovered emulators for PS1 and GameCube, and they’ve been a game-changer. Here’s what I use:

- **Atari** -> <a href='https://openemu.org/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">OpenEmu </a>
- **PS1** -> <a href='https://duckstation.org/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">DuckStation</a>
- **GameCube** -> <a href='https://dolphin-emu.org/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Dolphin</a>

These emulators work great for playing my favorite old games. I connected a controller, and using a projector for a better screen experience. It works like a charm.

### favorite childhood games

Here are some of the games that take me right back to my childhood:


- **Atari**: <a href='https://indiegamerchick.com/2024/05/26/the-flintstones-surprise-at-dinosaur-peak-nes-review/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">The Flintstones - The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak</a>, <a href='https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/578282-circus-charlie/reviews/169271/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Circus Charlie</a>, <a href='https://hive.blog/hive-140217/@thehollow/review-adventure-island-nes-version' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Adventure Island</a>, <a href='https://digitizerworld.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/game-production-battle-city/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Battle City</a>. Remembering staying awake until the morning playing all with my cousins.
- **PS1**: <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/looney-tunes-sheep-raider/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Looney Tunes: Sheep Raider</a>, <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/disneys-hercules-action-game/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Disney's Hercules</a>, <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/disneys-tarzan/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Disney's Tarzan</a>.

 I did not have **GameCube** but <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/scooby-doo-night-of-100-frights/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights</a> and <a href='https://www.metacritic.com/game/scooby-doo-mystery-mayhem/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Mayhem</a> is on the list for that.

I’m a really nostalgic person and a big fan of the ‘90s and early ‘00s. I don’t really like how fast everything moves now, especially with social media. I love slowing down, really getting into a game, and feeling like a kid again. Playing these old games brings back that feeling.

### what’s next?

For newer games, after It Takes Two, I’m really looking forward to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/split-fiction/" target='_blank' style="text-decoration:underline;">Split Fiction</a> coming soon from the same studio—it looks awesome! But until then, I’ll be sticking with retro gaming. Time to enjoy some classics.
